# Requests & Reports

## What is this ?

This is a repository for applications and reports relating to the Wabbajack gallery. Creators of unofficial lists that wish to apply for featured status can apply here. Furthermore, users can submit reports for lists that may be breaking any rules. Reports can be submitted for any lists that are breaking Nexus terms of service, distributing pirated mods, include paywalled content, etc. Reports can also be submitted for featured lists that no longer meet the requirements for featured status.

## Is this the finalized solution?  

Maybe, for now this can be considered a live beta test of the new system to see how well it works and if we need to add more fields or descriptions to the "Forms" (Issue Templates).

The way how list are tested doesn't not change but all conversion to as to why a list might got rejected is to be posted here. The conversation is open to anyone.
