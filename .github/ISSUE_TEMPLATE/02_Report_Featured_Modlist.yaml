        ## IMPORTANT NOTICE
        
        This report From is reseved for **serious** negligence by a modlist author of the requirements we set for featured lists and need to be seriously reviewed. [Wabbajack Featured List Criteria](https://wiki.wabbajack.org/wabbajack_cdn_and_gallery_access/Criteria%20for%20'Featured%20Mod%20List'%20status.html)  
        We require every report to feature strong proof of any accusation and reserve the right to ban people from accessing this service and dismiss frivolous reports. 
        The following are examples of things that can potentially get you banned:

        - Trying to get faster support
        - Reporting minor, non game breaking bugs
        - Reporting a Modlist just because you don't like the author
        - You were banned from a server or dislike their rules
        
        *ยน Timely in this context can and will be judged on a case by case basis, under the consideration that **ALL** of this is unpaid **VOLUNTEER** work. Author's real lives take priority, and temporary work arounds are considered under this criteria as "fixes" to an issue, within reason.
