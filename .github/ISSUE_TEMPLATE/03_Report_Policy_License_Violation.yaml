        ## IMPORTANT NOTICE
        
        This report form is reseved for **serious** violations to the Wabbajack Policies and License by a modlist author.
        Because of that we require every report to feature strong proof of any accusation and reserve the right to ban people from accessing this service.  
        The following are examples of things that can potentially get you banned:

        - Trying to get faster support  
        - Reporting minor, non game breaking bugs  
        - Reporting a Modlist just because you don't like the author  
        - You were banned from a server or dislike their rules  
        
        ***The biggest examples of what can and should be reported are:***   
          - Any paywalled access to modlists, including temporary files, betas, testing, or otherwise.
          - Illegal distribution of assets, either from mods or other sources, including but not limited to in the Wabbajack file or on the CDN.   

        - Wabbajack is *not* affiliated with Nexus Mods, discord, github, etc. That being said, we take their terms of service as seriously as our own and will not tolerate violations of their policies using our software.
